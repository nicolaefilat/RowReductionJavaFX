# RowReductionJavaFX
Java UI program that displays row reduction steps to bring any matrix to row echelon form with Latex

## Examples

## Usage
1. Install the dependencies with Maven
2. In the `Latex.java` class in main change the matrix variable to your own and run the application. 
```java
    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {
        loadFonts();
//        double[][] matrix = {
//                {1, 2, 0, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0},
//                {0, 5, 5, 9, 0, 1, 0, 0},
//                {2, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0},
//                {6, 5, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1}
//        };
        double[][] matrix = {
                {-4, 8, 1, -10},
                {-2, 0, -6, 8},
                {1, -2, -1, 3},
        };
        // other code
   }
```
Hope you will find this useful. I tried to make the algorithm use as little fractions as possbile but this does not always work. \
Have a nice day, and enjoy math :smile: !
